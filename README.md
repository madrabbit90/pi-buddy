A bare-bones, no frills, distraction-free sidebar menu sytem based on Rofi, sxhkd, and modified sidebar theme for handheld Linux systems that gets out of your way and lets you work.

When using a computer, I notice that I don't need the entire OS at my fingertips at all times. I just want to get back to what I was working on, quickly.

Clone this repo, run install.sh, set sxhkd to run at startup, edit the .mainmenu file to your liking, and you're good to go.

CTRL+l or ALT+l pulls up the sidebar. ESC cancels.

Anything with a main# tag will appear on the root menu. Commands with tags based on root menu options will appear and execute from the submenus. Knowing how to create Bash aliases at this point is super-helpful.
